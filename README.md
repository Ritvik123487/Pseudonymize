# Pseudonymize

Code not published as it is currently being used for privacy Protection 

Utilized Numpy and Pandas for data preprocessing: streamlined datasets by eliminating redundancies and rectifying corrupt entries
Integrated the software with GCP's de-identifying capabilities, and employed a Machine Learning-based fuzzy algorithm using PyTorch to pinpoint and pseudonymize PII data
